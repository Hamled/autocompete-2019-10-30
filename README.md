# AutoCompete 2019-10-30
Welcome to AutoCompete! Sign up and register your self and your team.

Today we're teaming up with Seattle JS Hackers and SeattleCSS! This means
we've gathered two fun types of problems for you to solve.

## CSS Contest
On the CSS side of things El from SeattleCSS has created three challenges for
you! Work through them and we'll take time at the end of the night to show off
what everyone created.

### Cute Halloween CSS Drawing
For this challenge, we would like you to create a Halloween themed pure CSS
drawing (with optional animation)! Maybe a jack o' lantern or a flying ghost.
This is an opportunity to get really creative and add something fun to your
Codepen!

Example: https://codepen.io/dazulu/pen/JaZKej

### Haunted Image
This challenge requires thinking outside the box. We want you to enhance an
already existing frightening photograph with creepy additions using only CSS.
Haunted house images will be provided!

### Halloween Landing Page
This challenge has more of a UX focus.  We want you to build a landing page
for Rosenheim Mansion (you can find info about it online).  You can go two
ways with this challenge: either put together landing page with a great user
experience, or  build the worst, most unusable and terrifying UX you can come
up with.

## Programming Contest
On the programming side we have a GitHub repo with a packet of problems.
Each problem requires writing a program that reads text input and prints
out the answer to the problem. You can use any programming language you
like to solve the problem!

Our judges will run your programs to verify output. We are especailly
well-suited to run Ruby, JavaScript and Python programs. If you plan to use
Java, C++, C#, Kotlin, Go, Rust, Julia, or anything else please let us know!
You are totally welcome to use any language you want, we just want to make
sure we can run your programs on our machines!

The problem set contains about 8 problems of varying difficulties. You may
solve them in any order you wish. You can have up to three people per team,
and only one laptop among those three people.

Read the rules in the repo.

The repo just contains these rules and explanations so far. The problem set
will be released when the contest begins. Perhaps wait to fork the repo (or
pull in changes) once the contest has started.
